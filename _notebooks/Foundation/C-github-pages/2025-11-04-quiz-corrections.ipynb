    "# AP CSP Practice Quiz Retrospective\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name:** [Anika Marathe]\n",
    "**Date:** [11/4/2025]\n",
    "**Score:** 44/66 (67%)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reflection on My Performance & Plan for Improvement**\n",
    "\n",
    "My score of 44 out of 66 on this practice quiz is a solid starting point and, more importantly, a very useful diagnostic tool. Achieving a 67% shows that I have a decent grasp of many high-level concepts in AP CSP, but it has also clearly illuminated the specific areas where I need to focus my efforts to improve. I feel that I understand the \"what\" and \"why\" of computing's impact, but I need to get stronger on the \"how\" of programming and algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "My plan for improvement is to shift from just recognizing concepts to actively applying them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Pre-Solving Before Answering:** For algorithm and robot questions, I will start by tracing the logic with a pencil and paper to predict the outcome myself before I even look at the multiple-choice options. This will help me avoid being tricked by plausible but incorrect answers.\n",
    "2.  **Line-by-Line Code Analysis:** When I review code segments, I will force myself to explain the purpose of each line. What does this variable hold? What condition is this loop checking? When will this `IF` statement be true? This will deepen my understanding of program flow.\n",
    "3.  **Targeted Practice:** Using the \"Grows\" list I created below, I will seek out and complete practice problems specifically focused on loops, Boolean logic, data compression, and algorithm runtime analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Detailed Corrections for Incorrect Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a breakdown of each question I got wrong, my misunderstanding, and the correct logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q1: Swap values first and second**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I chose `D. temp ← second`. I see now that this overwrites the temporary variable, losing the original value of `first` that we were trying to save.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** The correct sequence is to save `first` into `temp`, then move `second` into `first`, and finally move the saved value from `temp` into `second`. The missing line had to be **`B. second ← temp`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q14: Comparing loop algorithms**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I thought the programs would display the same values in a different order. I missed the crucial difference between displaying *before* incrementing vs. *after*.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** Program A displays `i` and *then* adds 1, so it shows 1 through 10. Program B adds 1 *then* displays `i`, so it shows 2 through 11. The correct answer is **C**, as they display the same quantity of numbers, but the values themselves are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q20: Finding the maximum value of three using MAX**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** My choice involved subtraction, which doesn't make sense for finding a maximum. I wasn't thinking about how to combine, or \"nest,\" procedures.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** To find the max of three numbers (`a, b, c`), you can find the max of two of them first, and then compare that result to the third one. The expression **`A. Max(Max(a, b), c)`** does exactly this.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q22: Procedure to determine the weather**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I chose `D`, which checked if `total > 0.5 * counter`. This is the reverse of what was needed.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** The goal is to see if the count of hot days (`counter`) is \"a majority\" of the `total` days. The correct Boolean logic for \"more than half\" is **`B. counter > 0.5 * total`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q24: Compression by replacing TH and IS with characters**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I incorrectly linked the idea of a transformation being lossless to it being secure.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** \"Lossless\" means that no data is lost and the original can be perfectly recreated. Since the problem states that a map of the substitutions is saved, we can reverse the process. Therefore, it is **`C. lossless transformation because an encoded string can be restored`**. Security is a separate concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q26: Completing robot code by adding if statement**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I chose a block of code that would have made the robot move in a small, repeating pattern rather than navigating toward the goal. My chosen logic always turned right, which isn't an effective navigation strategy.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** A good general algorithm for getting to a goal is to move forward if possible, and only turn if the path is blocked. The correct logic would use an `IF/ELSE` statement to check `CAN_MOVE(forward)` first.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q30: Video-streaming service by genre**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I only counted the first call to the `Analysis` procedure and forgot to account for the calls inside the loop.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** The `Analysis` procedure (which takes 1 hour) is called once before the loop and once for each of the four genres inside the loop. That's a total of 1 + 4 = 5 calls. The correct answer is **D. 5 hours**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q31: Comparing loop algorithms with robots**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I correctly identified that Program II worked but failed to trace Program I all the way through, incorrectly assuming it would fail.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** Program I's sequence of `FORWARD, LEFT, FORWARD, RIGHT` effectively moves the robot one square up and one square left for each of the 4 repetitions, successfully reaching the goal. Program II's wall-following algorithm also works. Therefore, **`C. Both program I and program II correctly move the robot to the gray square`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q33: Apartment rental Web site flowchart**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I misinterpreted the flow of the diagram as an `AND` condition.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** The flowchart sets `include` to `true` if `floor > 10` is true OR if `bedrooms = 3` is true. If either path leads to `include ← true`, it's an **`A. OR`** condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q39: Internet open standards and protocols**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I chose an answer related to sharing material, which is more of a copyright issue than a technical one.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** The primary benefit of open standards like TCP/IP and HTTP is ensuring **interoperability**. This means that hardware and software from different companies can all communicate successfully. The correct answer is **A**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q43: Runtime of algorithm for online retailer**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I saw the numbers getting large quickly and assumed it was an \"unreasonable\" time.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** The number of steps is n² (10 -> 100, 20 -> 400). An n² runtime is a polynomial runtime, which is considered **`A. reasonable`** in AP CSP. Unreasonable is generally reserved for exponential or factorial runtimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q44: Using a 4 bit representation for integers**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I made an error in my binary addition or in calculating the maximum value.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** With 4 bits, the largest non-negative integer we can represent is 15 (`1111`).\n",
    "        *   I. `4 + 8 = 12` (No overflow)\n",
    "        *   II. `7 + 10 = 17` (**Overflow**)\n",
    "        *   III. `12 + 3 = 15` (No overflow)\n",
    "    *   Only operation II results in a number greater than 15. The answer is **B. II only**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q45: NAND logic gate**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I confused the logic for a NAND gate.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** A NAND gate is the opposite of an AND gate. This means you evaluate `(P AND Q)` first, and then apply a `NOT` to the result. The correct expression is **`C. NOT (P AND Q)`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q46: Infinite loops in undecidable problems**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I thought that an undecidable problem was just a very slow or complex problem that could be solved with enough computing power.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** The key to an \"undecidable problem\" is that it's been proven that **no algorithm can ever exist** to solve it for all cases. It's a logical impossibility, not a hardware limitation. The answer is **D**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q48: Science experiment with 75 percent successful trials**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I chose the option that checked if the random number was *exactly* 75, which is only a 1% chance.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** To simulate a 75% chance using `RANDOM(1, 100)`, we need a condition that is true for 75 of the 100 possible outcomes. **`D. RANDOM(1, 100) is less than or equal to 75`** accomplishes this, as it will be true for the numbers 1, 2, ..., 75.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q55: Results of the KeepPlaying procedure**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I didn't fully evaluate the `IF` condition.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** The condition is `(response = \"y\") AND (response = \"yes\")`. A variable can't be equal to two different things at once, so this condition is **always false**. The procedure will always run the `ELSE` block, meaning it **`D. returns false no matter what`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q56: Skip counting integers in a loop**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I mis-tracked the variables. I likely calculated the sum of even numbers or stopped at the wrong value.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** The variable `count` starts at 1 and is incremented by 2 ten times. This means it takes on the values 1, 3, 5, ..., 19. The program is summing the first 10 odd integers, which is **D. the sum of the odd integers from 1 to 19**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q58: Defining Internet enabled crowdsourcing**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I incorrectly believed that crowdsourcing could solve any computational problem given enough users.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** While the Internet helps crowdsourcing by breaking down geographic barriers (II) and providing access to tools (I), it cannot make undecidable problems solvable. Some problems are impossible to solve with an algorithm, regardless of computing power. The answer is **A. I and II only**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q61: Data about students at East and West High schools**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I did not correctly identify which data fields were common to *both* datasets.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** To combine the data, I can only perform operations on fields that both schools provide. Both have First/Last Names and Days Absent. Only East has ZIP Codes, and only West has Student IDs. Therefore, I can **A. sort by last name** and **B. find the average days absent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q62: Compare online encyclopedia with paper encyclopedia**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I chose an incorrect advantage. It's actually a disadvantage that it's hard to check for copyrighted content on a user-editable site.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** The key advantages of an online encyclopedia are the **C. ability to have a larger number of perspectives** and the **D. ability to quickly update content**, which a printed book cannot do.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q64: Cloud computing and the Internet**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I misunderstood the relationship between cloud computing and redundancy.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** Cloud computing *increases* the need for network redundancy for reliability. Its main impacts have been to **B. enhance collaboration** (through shared services like Google Docs) and to **C. introduce new data-security concerns** (by having a third party hold your data).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Q65: Correcting errors in procedure Multiply**\n",
    "    *   **My Mistake:** I didn't consider the edge case of a negative input for `y`.\n",
    "    *   **Correction:** The procedure works by counting up from 0 until `count` equals `y`. If `y` is a negative number, the `count` will increment infinitely without ever meeting the `REPEAT UNTIL` condition, causing an infinite loop. This fails when **B. x is positive and y is negative** and **D. x is negative and y is negative**.\n",
