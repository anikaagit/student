    "When I first started AP CSP, I struggled with collaboration and advocating for my ideas. I often found it difficult to work in a team without feeling unsure about my contributions. But now, I have learned how to collaborate more effectively, like during our group coding assignment where I suggested a new debugging approach that helped my team complete the project faster. I suggested that instead of trying random fixes, we first add print statements at key points in the code.\n",

    "Work habits and organization have also improved. I used to procrastinate on some assignments, but I now keep my files and projects better organized, which helps me turn in work more consistently.  \n",
