But now, I have learned how to collaborate more effectively, like during our group coding assignment where I suggested a new debugging approach that helped my team complete the project faster. I suggested that instead of trying random fixes, we first add print statements at key points in the code.\n",

    "I also improved my technical skills. At the beginning, I was only confident in basic coding. Now, I can apply new coding strategies and explain tech concepts to my peers, though I still get nervous presenting in front of the class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Work habits and organization have also improved. I used to procrastinate on some assignments, but I now keep my files and projects better organized, which helps me turn in work more consistently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, I want to continue improving my advocacy skills and feel more comfortable communicating my ideas clearly. I also aim to strengthen my tech presentations so I can confidently share my knowledge with peers. Overall, I am proud of the growth I have made in teamwork, technical skills, and professional behaviors, and I am motivated to keep improving these areas.  \n"
